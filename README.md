# 🎮 FiNAF-Game-Hub
"Fun() is not a Function" Game Hub 
> **🚨 WARNING:** This project is currently under development!!!

## 🧐 What is this?
**FiNAF-Game-Hub** is a tribute to the most famous error in JavaScript history: `TypeError: Fun is not a function`. 

This is a collection of mini-games built strictly using the **Holy Trinity** of Frontend: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. No React, no Vue, no jQuery—just pure, unadulterated, and occasionally chaotic source code.
